# 🚀 My AI Hackathon Experience in Bogotá – Building FIABLE with a Global Team

Landing in Bogotá with no expectations and just a backpack, I had no idea I'd walk away with a finalist AI app, amazing teammates, and unforgettable inspiration.

This blog shares what we built, how we built it, and why I’d do it all over again.

## ⚡ 3 Days. 1 Hackathon. A Lifetime of Value.

From **Saturday, August 23 to Monday, August 25**, I was part of the **IA Hackathon** in Bogotá, Colombia—a fast-paced, high-energy event focused on building innovative AI products.

Despite the short stay, the experience was deeply impactful. We brainstormed, built, and bonded fast—and the results surprised even us.

## 🌎 Immersed in Bogotá’s Tech Vibe

Though I was in Bogotá from **August 23 to 25**, I experienced a lot:

- Stayed in **La Castellana**, a peaceful, green neighborhood
- Enjoyed **sunny but chilly mornings**
- Loved the calm, quiet nights—perfect for focused coding
- Missed tourist spots like **Monserrate** and **el centro**, but I’ll be back!

## 💬 Mentors, Makers & Connections

This wasn’t your average hackathon. It was full of **brilliant LatAm builders** and inspiring leaders.

I had the chance to talk with:
- [Adrián Mastronardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amastronardi/) – CTO at Habi  
- [Andrés Bilbao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andresbilbao/) – Co-founder of Rappi

## 💡 What I Learned

- **Execute fast, but with clarity.** Understand the real problem before building.
- **Team communication = everything.**
- **Taking risks opens doors.** I came to Colombia alone, and left with a crew.
- **Done is better than perfect.** Deadlines are a feature, not a bug.

## ✈️ Would I Do It Again?

**Absolutely. In a heartbeat.**

I’d 100% recommend this to anyone who wants to push themselves, build quickly, and meet amazing people along the way.

Next time, I’ll stay longer and explore more of Bogotá’s **tech scene and cultural gems**.
