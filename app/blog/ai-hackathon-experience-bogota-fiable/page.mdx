# 🚀 My AI Hackathon Experience in Bogotá – Building FIABLE

Landing in Bogotá with no expectations and just a backpack, I had no idea I'd walk away with a finalist AI app, amazing teammates, and unforgettable inspiration.

This blog shares what we built, how we built it, and why I’d do it all over again.

## ⚡ 3 Days. 1 Hackathon. A Lifetime of Value.

From **Saturday, August 23 to Monday, August 25**, I was part of the **IA Hackathon** in Bogotá, Colombia—a fast-paced, high-energy event focused on building innovative AI products.

Despite the short stay, the experience was deeply impactful. We brainstormed, built, and bonded fast—and the results surprised even us.

## ⚙️ What We Built: FIABLE

**FIABLE** is a WhatsApp-based AI assistant that helps users manage their personal finances automatically.

We designed FIABLE for simplicity—no apps to install, no spreadsheets to fill out. Just smart automation in your pocket.

### 🧰 Tech Stack:
- `n8n` – Workflow automation (Gmail + Supabase logic)
- `Supabase` – Database and auth layer
- `v0.dev` – Quick frontend prototyping
- `Evolution API` – WhatsApp communication

## 👨‍💻 My Role: Technical Lead & Vibe Coder

I led development for the **n8n automation**, which powered email parsing, receipt detection, and memory storage.

## 🌎 Immersed in Bogotá’s Tech Vibe

Though I was in Bogotá from **August 23 to 25**, I experienced a lot:

- Stayed in **La Castellana**, a peaceful, green neighborhood
- Enjoyed **sunny but chilly mornings**
- Loved the calm, quiet nights—perfect for focused coding
- Enjoyed local food like **arepas**, **pandebono**, and **limonada de coco**

## 💬 Mentors, Makers & Connections

This wasn’t your average hackathon. It was full of **brilliant LatAm builders** and inspiring leaders.

I had the chance to meet:
- [Adrián Mastronardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amastronardi/) – CTO at Habi  
- [Andrés Bilbao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahbilbao/) – Co-founder of Rappi  
- [Anthony Cueva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cuevaio/) – Next.js Global Hackathon Winner

The event was powered by the **Makers Fellowship**—a community of top-tier Latin American developers and dreamers.

## 💡 What I Learned

- **Execute fast, but with clarity.** Understand the real problem before building.
- **Team communication = everything.**
- **Taking risks opens doors.** I came to Colombia alone, and left with a crew.
- **Done is better than perfect.** Deadlines are a feature, not a bug.

---

## ✈️ Would I Do It Again?

**Absolutely. In a heartbeat.**

I’d 100% recommend this to anyone who wants to push themselves, build quickly, and meet amazing people along the way.

Next time, I’ll stay longer and explore more of Bogotá’s **tech scene and cultural gems**.
